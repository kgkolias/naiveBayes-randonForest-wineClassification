1) The 'machine_learning_coursework.m' file which contains the matlab code
for both Naive Bayes and Random Forest models. 
The code is separated in sections that we would propose to be ran sequentially.
You will also find comments that provide a brief overview of the code.
The approximate execution time of all the code sections is 18 mins including the 
grid search of the Random Forest model which takes approximately 15 mins.  

2) The 'WineScaled.csv' file contains the wine dataset from UCI 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) that has been preprocessed in Python
and its data have been scaled with values from 0 to 1.
